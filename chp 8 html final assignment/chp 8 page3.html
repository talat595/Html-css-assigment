            <strong>Why it's special:</strong> Robby incorporates an interactive
            experience into his portfolio.<br />
            <strong>What it's about:</strong> If you associate portfolios with a dry
            list of facts, this portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a novel
            way of displayin what otherwise was dry information - he laid out his
            portfolio site as a video game that the visitor can acutally play. This
            incredibly fun interactive design portfolio will make you scroll.
